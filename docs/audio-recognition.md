# Audio Recognition Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to implement a Shazam-like audio recognition feature in SmartPlaylist. This feature will allow users to identify songs by recording a short audio sample through their device's microphone.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Audio Fingerprinting
- Use audio fingerprinting algorithms to create unique digital signatures of songs
- Implement spectral analysis to extract distinctive features from audio samples
- Consider using existing audio fingerprinting libraries:
  - Chromaprint (used by AcoustID)
  - dejavu
  - Soundfingerprinting

### 2. Database Requirements
- Create a fingerprint database to store audio signatures
- Store reference points for each song:
  - Frequency peaks
  - Time markers
  - Amplitude patterns
- Index the database for fast querying
- Link fingerprints to song metadata in existing database

### 3. Client-Side Implementation
- Implement browser audio capture using Web Audio API
- Features needed:
  - Microphone access permission handling
  - Real-time audio processing
  - Sample rate normalization
  - Noise reduction
  - Audio buffer management

### 4. Server-Side Processing
- Create API endpoints for:
  - Receiving audio samples
  - Processing fingerprints
  - Matching against database
  - Returning results
- Implement efficient matching algorithms
- Handle concurrent recognition requests

### 5. Integration Options

#### Option 1: Build Custom Solution
**Pros:**
- Full control over implementation
- No dependency on external services
- No usage fees

**Cons:**
- Complex implementation
- Requires significant processing power
- Need to maintain own song database
- Time-consuming development

#### Option 2: Use External APIs
**Recommended APIs:**
1. ACRCloud
   - Professional audio recognition service
   - Large music database
   - Good documentation
   - Usage-based pricing

2. Audd.io
   - Specialized in music recognition
   - Simple REST API
   - Reasonable pricing
   - Good accuracy

3. Gracenote
   - Industry standard
   - Extensive music database
   - Professional support
   - Enterprise-level solution

**Pros:**
- Faster implementation
- Reliable and tested solution
- Regular database updates
- Professional support

**Cons:**
- Ongoing costs
- API rate limits
- Dependency on external service

### 6. Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: MVP
1. Integrate with chosen external API (recommended: ACRCloud or Audd.io)
2. Implement basic audio recording
3. Create simple UI for recording
4. Display matched song results

#### Phase 2: Enhancement
1. Add error handling for poor audio quality
2. Implement offline queuing
3. Add visual feedback during recording
4. Cache recent searches

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Add song preview after recognition
2. Implement batch recognition
3. Add to playlist functionality
4. Share recognition results

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Web Audio API support
- MediaRecorder API
- AudioContext for processing
- Proper error handling for browser compatibility

### Backend
- Audio processing capabilities
- API rate limiting
- Response caching
- Error handling

### Infrastructure
- Audio processing servers
- Caching layer
- Load balancing for concurrent requests

## Cost Considerations

### Development Costs
- Initial API integration: 40-60 hours
- Frontend implementation: 30-40 hours
- Backend services: 20-30 hours
- Testing and refinement: 20-30 hours

### Operational Costs
- API usage fees (varies by provider):
  - ACRCloud: Starting from $99/month
  - Audd.io: Starting from $49/month
  - Gracenote: Custom enterprise pricing
- Server processing costs
- Database storage
- Bandwidth costs

## Recommendations

1. **Initial Implementation:**
   - Start with Audd.io API integration
   - Implement basic recording functionality
   - Focus on user experience and error handling

2. **Future Expansion:**
   - Consider building custom solution if usage grows significantly
   - Implement caching to reduce API calls
   - Add offline support

3. **Success Metrics:**
   - Recognition accuracy rate
   - Response time
   - User adoption rate
   - Cost per recognition

## Security Considerations

1. **User Privacy:**
   - Clear microphone permission requests
   - Transparent data handling
   - Secure audio transmission

2. **Data Protection:**
   - Encrypted audio transmission
   - Secure API key storage
   - Rate limiting per user

3. **Compliance:**
   - GDPR considerations
   - Audio data retention policies
   - User consent management

## Timeline Estimate

1. **Planning & Setup:** 1 week
   - API selection
   - Architecture design
   - Environment setup

2. **Basic Implementation:** 2-3 weeks
   - API integration
   - Basic UI/UX
   - Core functionality

3. **Testing & Refinement:** 1-2 weeks
   - Bug fixing
   - Performance optimization
   - User testing

4. **Launch & Monitoring:** 1 week
   - Deployment
